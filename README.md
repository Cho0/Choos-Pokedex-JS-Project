# Choos-Pokedex-JS-Project
This is a Jason Choo's javascript pokedex project.

In a future update to the website, I would like to make a searchbar 
that is activated by pressing the pokeball's inner circle.
The circle would slide to the left as a search bar would show itself
in the trail of the circle.

I would also like to find a way to switch to the other generations of pokemon
using the center button. I'm thinking of a menu that would appear when pressing the 
same button that would pull up the search bar. On the right side would be the 
search bar but on the left side, I'd like to put a fanned menu that comes out of the
center button. I think this animation would give the website a very refined look.

The header with the pokemon logo can be changed in the future to be something more
custom. As it is, it doesn't really match the minimalist asthetic.

If I had to change one thing, it would be the modal itself. The modal given to us by 
the lesson is a bit limiting because I liked the modal I already had. But the current 
modal is probably more efficient.

One more idea I have is to add a place to input a number and it will take you to the 
number corresponding with the pokemon's pokedex entry number. (For both National Dex 
and Regional Dex).

For ease of access, I also think it's a good idea to load all the pokemon at once
on one page because it is more practical for the user. Finding the fastest way to do it is another thing I would have to think about.
